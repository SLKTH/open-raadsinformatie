Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

.. attention::

   Anytime Open Raadsinformatie is mentioned, please be aware that the same goes for the Open Stateninformatie API.

This part of the documentation answers common questions about the Open Raadsinformatie and Open Stateninformatie and Open Stateninformatie API.

.. _api_names:

What is the difference between Open Raadsinformatie and Open Stateninformatie?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They are  one and the same. The only difference is the URL, but you can query the Open Raadsinformatie API for provincial data and vice versa. The search applications are different though.

.. _date_granularity:

What does ``date_granularity`` mean?
------------------------------------
Dates are fickle things. A date is a particular point in time, and can be represented in `very many ways <http://xkcd.com/1179/>`_. In addition, dates have gradations in precision. For example, ``Jan. 1970`` is not as precise as ``1 January 1970 00:00:00`` is.

The different data sources in the Open Raadsinformatie API expose dates with very different precisions (``Vr 20 mei 2015 18:00``, ``1 January 2010``, etc.), often because that is as precise as the collection owner *knows*. In order to be able to reason about these dates, we opted to generate a full-fledged date anyway (so ``Jan. 2010`` becomes ``2010-01-01:00:00:00``), and store its ``granularity`` alongside it. The granularity signifies how **precise** the date is known; it is an integer, which indicates *how many digits* of the (IS-formatted) date were known.

+----------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Example date   | Granularity    | Description                                             |
+================+================+=========================================================+
| 21th century   | 2              | ``21th century`` means ``between 2000 and 2100``        |
+----------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| 2010           | 4              | We know the year exactly, so we know the first 4 digits |
+----------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| January 2010   | 6              | Month and year                                          |
+----------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| 1 January 2010 | 8              | Day, month and year                                     |
