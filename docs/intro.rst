Introduction
============

.. attention::

   Anytime Open Raadsinformatie is mentioned, please be aware that the same goes for the Open Stateninformatie API.

The Open Raadsinformatie and Open Stateninformatie API contain data from different sources. There is a combined index which allows for searching through the basics of each data source, i.e. the title, description, etc. There are also separate indexes for each individual municipality or province. The APIs follow a common design (REST) and document format (JSON), known by many developers.

Features
--------

* Data of different municipalities and provinces are made searchable in a uniform manner.
* When possible, references to the original item's location (in the form of URLs) are included.
* A simple REST API to easily search, filter and retrieve items.
